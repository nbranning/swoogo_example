# Swoogo Technical Test

This technical test was created using Laravel 10 as a api endpoint, html, VueJs, and Tailwind css. This example is a simple read only single page site that creates a api connection to the Swoogo API and displays an event and its sessions.

## Installation

Install Docker. Run Docker image

## Usage

Run docker and go to http://localhost in your browser. 

## Contributing

This is just an example.


## Improvements

There are many improvements that could be made in this example. Most notably would be the finishing of the event layout. Also some animations and some other interactive features. But there are many things that would need to be done before it could be improved. Validation and error handling at the top of the list.
